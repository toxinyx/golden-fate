    <p>
      Skulk folk are <em>not</em> well documented by any region within the country. Information written on this page is not information readily available to the public, nor to many higher-status individuals. Some people may even be entirely unaware that these creatures exist(ed) or may consider them a long gone myth of the land.

      basic Information
    </div>
    <p>
      <center>Skulk are also sometimes referred to as <em>'Dōkutsu no Ikimono <strong>(洞窟の生き物)</strong>'</em>, which translates to '<em>Cave Dwellers</em>'.</center>
    </p>

      Naming Schemes
    </div>
    <p>
      The naming conventions of these simplistic rock creatures are just as simple as themselves and may not be outwardly understandable to the outside viewer. On the <strong>extremely rare occasion</strong> that a Skulk interacts with a human, the human may choose to give the Skulk a name and that Skulk may choose to adopt said name as their standing alias. This has only happened <em>once</em> in hundreds of years, a testiment to how rare an event of such caliber occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst themselves, Skulk have found it difficult to assign each other names due to their incredibly simplistic form of communication and reliance on echolocation. Within the culture, they are instead defined on the 'type' or 'role' of their being, such as being a <em>Hunter</em> or a <em>Sea</em> Skulk. They may also assign each other simple, identifying words based on a certain formation in their appearance or the strength of their energy.
      <br><br>
      Names amongst Skulk may include things like <em>Moss</em> for a Skulk who's body is covered with a large quanitity of moss: or <em>Sharp</em> for a Skulk who's rock formation consists primarily of very sharp rocks instead of smooth ones. Names of this nature are almost always one word only for ease of communication.

      Characteristics (Appearance)
    </div>
    <p>
      While Skulk have existed for a very long time, from an evolutionary perspective they have not evolved since nearly perfecting their creation. They have not needed to evolve too much due to their pacifistic nature and tendencies to stay exclusively underground.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Height and Weight</strong>;
      <br>
      The average height for a Skulk ranges between <em>7'2</em> to <em>7'8</em>.
      <br>
      Skulk that are between <em>6'4</em> and <em>6'10</em> are considered '<strong>runts</strong>.'
      <br>
      Skulk smaller than <em>6'3</em> are typically <strong>defective</strong>. More on defective Skulk is detailed in the biology section of this page.
      <br><br>
      Skulk's weight range varies, but they are typically very heavy. It is difficult to provide an average, as many Skulk are composed of a variety of different organic materials in different percentages. Determining the weight of a Skulk character relies on knowing the weight of the materials the Skulk is made of and how that may contribute in a group mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Body</strong>;
      <br>
      The Skulk form is composed of the environment around their soul crystal. Due to their living conditions, the majority of Skulk are composed of rock formations, minerals, and other items otherwise found deep in the caves. Some Skulk are naturally formed with significant difference due to the <em>amount of energy</em> that their core produces, causing them to be better suited for certain variants (detailed under 'subspecies'). The Crystals embedded within a Skulk come in a range of colours, typically segregated by type or subspecies.
      <br><br>
      Skulk <em>do not</em> come born with an assigned gender. All Skulk are <em>genderless</em>, unless the Skulk themselves want to assign themself a human gender. The majority of Skulk deem this as pointless, but few that enjoy human culture or have an interest in it enjoy assigning themselves one and it has become an accepted thing to do in their communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Eyes</strong>;
      <br>
      The Skulk do not have functioning eyes. Not in the way that regular people do. To see and communicate, they rely primarily on echolocation and vibrations. More of echolocation is devolved in the 'Society' section of this page.

      Typical Attitudes/Personality Traits
    </div>
    <p>
      Skulk are very community-centered and it is not often that they have a <em>strong sense of self-identity</em>. With their consciousness <em>does</em> come free will, so they do have a sembelance of a personality and can influence their own thoughts and feelings. It is just good to remember that they are also raised from creation to value community and colony above all else, and that they provide use through work and collaboration with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>COMMON Traits</strong> displayed by Skulk include:
      <br>
      <em>Comradery, loyalty, kindness, timidness, nervousness</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Emotional Capacity</strong>;
      <br>
      Emotional intelligence is not entirely lost on Skulk as a concept. They <em>do</em> feel, and they can experience a short range of emotions. They can feel sadness, they can grieve, they can be happy. They can experience affection, but this forms in comradery and community rather than an individual experience one may have. Romance and sex are lost to these creatures due to their inability to have sexual experiences (lack of sexual organs and genitals) and their lack of need for intimacy in such a way.
